Introduction
======================================

AppImage provides a way for upstream developers to provide "native" binaries for Linux users just the same way they could do for other operating systems. It allow packaging applications for any common Linux based operating system, e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, RHEL, CentOS, Fedora etc. Properly built AppImages come with all their dependencies and will run on most Linux distributions without further modifications.

AppImage is designed to be a standalone standard, implemented in a so-called reference implementation provided in AppImageKit_.
